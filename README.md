# rest_api_calculator
Implement a Web platform to provide a simple calculator functionality (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, free form and a random string generation) where each functionality will have a separate cost per request. User’s will have a starting credit / balance. Each request will be deducted from the user’s balance. If the user’s balance isn’t enough to cover the request cost, the request shall be denied. This REST API application and its UI application should be live (on any platform of your choice) and should be ready to be configured and used locally for any other user (having all instructions written for this purpose).
